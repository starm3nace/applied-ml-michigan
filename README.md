This Nov. 2016 article by Zachary C. Lipton from the blog Approximately Correct discusses why and how automated processes for decision-making, particularly applications of machine learning, can exhibit bias in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. It's self-contained and includes a mini-review of machine learning concepts that reinforces what's covered in Module 1. This reading is optional for completion of the course.
